### Python module for physicochemical amino acid replacement distances

Amino acid replacements (also referred to as substitutions) are changes from one amino acid to a different one in a protein - and there are different ways to assess the difference between the two amino acids that come into play in an amino acid replacement. One can look at one or several properties' discrepancy between two amino acids. To list only a few: polarity, molecular volume / relative sizes of amino-acid side chains, mean number of lone pair electrons on the side-chain, maximum moment of inertia for rotation at the α―β bond or at the β―γ bond or at the γ―δ bond, presence of a pyrrolidine ring (proline (P)), experimental protein activity and stability after exchanging one amino acid into another, Chou-Fasman alpha helical, beta strand and/or reverse turn propensity parameters, etc.
pard is a package designed to make those Physicochemical Amino acid Replacement Distances calculations straightforward with Python. One typical use is to establish a 'distance' between a wild-type protein and its mutated version. Sometimes, rather than a distance, a similarity is outputted (e.g. with the Conformational similarity weight matrix or EMPAR). The higher the distance, the more different the two amino acids are. The higher the similarity, the more similar the two amino acids are. Whenever a distance is not outputted but rather a similarity, a warning (that the user can turn off) will be raised.
